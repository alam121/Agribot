# Agribot
Our research is segmented into three focal areas: 1) The construction of the Agri-bot using Brushless DC motors and controllers 2) Integration of depth camera-assisted robot perception for autonomous crop row navigation and 3) A self-supervised navigation algorithm to guide the robot across uneven, unstructured terrains
